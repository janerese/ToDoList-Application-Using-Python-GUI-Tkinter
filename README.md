# ToDoList-Application-Using-Python-GUI-Tkinter

I was interested in making my own to-do list application. 
I made this to-do list application using Python GUI Tkinter.

Idea:
In the YouTube video link listed above, I learned how to do a to-do list application using Python GUI Tkinter.
I have always been quite disorganized, that's why I was interested in making this project.
I can apply this to my everyday life or school life. 
With this, I can track all the things I need to accomplish.
There are four different functions which are adding, deleting, saving, and loading tasks.
The saving and loading tasks functions are especially important so I can still see all the tasks I added even when I close the application.
